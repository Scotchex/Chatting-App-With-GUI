# Chatting-App-With-GUI
You can use these programmes for any non commercial usage. 
This was written in Python,to use you will need to install (if they're not installed by default) socket & tkinter libraries.
First run the server.py file then, run the client.py on every computer you want to use.
When you run the client, it's going to ask for the host and the port, host is the IPV4 adress of the computer that's running the server.
Port is = 33000 which is changable from the code.
If you are going to run the client and the server at the same machine you need to use the 127.0.0.1 IP adress as your host.
